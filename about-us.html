                        <h2>About PuffOff</h2>
                        <p>
                            Quitting vaping is one of the hardest challenges many people face, and PuffOff is here to change that. Backed by cutting-edge AI and built on real human experiences, PuffOff is a revolutionary app designed to transform the way you approach quitting. Forget the rigid counters and cold statistics—PuffOff combines personalized insights, engaging tools, and an empathetic design to help you succeed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Founded by <strong>Jonathan Royère</strong>, a software developer with 10+ years of experience and a former vaper for over 7 years, PuffOff was created to address the frustrations he faced in his own quitting journey. Traditional solutions treated quitting as binary—success or failure—without acknowledging the complexity of addiction. PuffOff redefines quitting by embracing the journey, not just the destination.
